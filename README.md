# Leaderboard Archiver

This is a development only repository for archiving leaderboard data.

## Important Notes

- The code contains a hardcoded path `os.chdir(r"C:\coding\leaderboardArchiver")` for GitHub operations
- You will need to modify this path to match your local environment
- Update the `DB_LINK` environment variable with leaderboard URL
- Set the `USER_TOKEN` environment variable with authentication token
